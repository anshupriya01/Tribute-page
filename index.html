        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam  (About this soundlisten); 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) 
        was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.
         He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
          He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
           Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
            was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
             efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
              of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisat
              ional, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first
               since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

        Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling
         Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to
          as the "People's President",[6] he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and
           public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, 
           including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.

        While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong,
         Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83.
          Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held
           in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

    <h1 class="heading">Career as a scientist</h1>
    <p>After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical 
        Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation 
        (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming 
        a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
         by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
         [26] Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the
          renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research 
          Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle 
          (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam 
          had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.[1] In 1969, 
          Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.[25]
          </p>

        <p>
        Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT Guwahati
        In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia;
         Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility.
         [11][27] Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the Polar
          Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
          </p>
        
          <p>
        Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test Smiling Buddha
         as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not participated in its development. In the
          1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to 
          develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme.[28] Despite 
          the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for
           these aerospace projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's directorship.[28] Kalam 
           played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified 
           ospace projects.[28] His research and educational leadership brought him great laurels and prestige
            in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his
             directorship.[28] Kalam and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the
              Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister, R. Venkataraman
               on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking 
               planned missiles one after another.[29] R Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the 
               cabinet approval for allocating ₹ 3.88 billion for the mission, named Integrated Guided 
               Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief executive.[29]
                Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles under the mission including Agni, 
                an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile,
                 although the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time overruns.

        <p>
        Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence 
        Research and Development Organisation from July 1992 to December 1999. The Pokhran-II nuclear tests
         were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive political and technological role.
          Kalam served as the Chief Project Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the
           testing phase.[11][31] Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's
            best known nuclear scientist.[32] However, the director of the site test, K Santhanam,
             said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing 
             an incorrect report.[33] Both Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims.[34]

        <p>
        In 1998, along with cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named the
         "Kalam-Raju Stent".[35][36] In 2012, the duo designed a rugged tablet computer for health care 
         in rural areas, which was named the "Kalam-Raju Tablet".[37]

            <p>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won 
                 by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.[38]

                On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, 
                expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the 
                Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[41][42] After the
                 Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term
                  in office, leaving the field clear.]

                    The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament 
                    and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided 
                    affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.
                    [46] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[47]
                     and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[48] Kalam was 
                     the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest 
                     civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
                      Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President
                       of India.[49] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati 
                       Bhawan.

                  <p>
                    In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need
                     of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.
                     [60][61][62][63]

                    At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness
                     to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about
                      his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[64] However, two days later,
                       he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to 
                       avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[65] He did not have 
                       the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed
                        mandate.[

                                    <p>Kalam served as the 11th President of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002
                                         presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won 
                                         by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from 25 July 2002 to 25 July 2007.[38]

                                        On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, 
                                        expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the post of President,[39][40] and both the 
                                        Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy.[41][42] After the
                                         Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term
                                          in office, leaving the field clear.]

                                            The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002 in Parliament 
                                            and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the election was a one-sided 
                                            affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July.
                                            [46] Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,[47]
                                             and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[48] Kalam was 
                                             the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest 
                                             civilian honour, before becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir
                                              Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President
                                               of India.[49] He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati 
                                               Bhawan.

                                            In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need
                                             of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.

                                            At the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness
                                             to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about
                                              his victory in the 2007 presidential election.[64] However, two days later,
                                               he decided not to contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to 
                                               avoid involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes.[65] He did not have 
                                               the support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive a renewed
